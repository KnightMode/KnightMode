## 👋 About Me

Having dabbled in mobile, backend, and frontend, I've seen how small improvements in tooling can save hours of frustration.

So I spend my time working on things that might make code a bit easier to write and maintain.

I think good developer tools should just work—simple enough to understand quickly, but capable enough to handle the messy real-world stuff. That's what I try to build.

## 📝 What I'm Working On

Building tools that make development smoother, faster, and more enjoyable. If it saves time and reduces frustration, I'm interested.
